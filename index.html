		<h1>The Good and The Bad</h1>
		<h2>The Story of a Boy</h2>
		<p>Once upon a time, There was a young child who was taught by his parents to always do good in life because in return you will get nothing but good things
		<p>The child grew up and became a young adult, and had realized that not all people are good, infact the ones who do bad sometimes get what they want faster than being good, so he started getting frustrated and impaitent for the good things to come back.
		<p>The young adult was concerened about how his life would turn out to be if he had continued doing nothing but good for himself and the people he's surrounded by, so he had 2 choices in his life
		<p>But before we check out these choices, let's see what it's like to be <strong><a href="Good.html">Good</a></strong> or <strong><a href="Bad.html">Bad</a></strong> </p>
		<h3>First Choice: <a href="BeingGood.html">To Be Good</a></h3>
